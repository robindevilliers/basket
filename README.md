# basket

Please write a java 8 program that takes a basket of items and outputs its total cost.
The basket can contain one or more of the following items: Bananas, Oranges, Apples, Lemons, Peaches

### Comments
* I'd much prefer to leave the description of line item as a string.  But then the basket could except anything.  The requirements explicitly state the allowed items.
